# AI for Health Collectives

The UC Davis AI for Health Research Center is a cross-college hub jointly anchored in the Department of Computer Science College of Engineering (CoE)) and the Department of Radiology (School of Medicine (SOM)). The Center's purpose is to catalyze research, education, translation, and responsible innovation in artificial intelligence (AI) for health. Specific goals are to:

- Serve the needs of its constitutive departments and UC Davis broadly.

- Build a community around AI for Health through durable bridges between engineering and medicine for funding, research and education.

- Establish shared resources for research and education, e.g., datasets, compute environments, and models.

- Provide a welcoming, intellectually vibrant home for graduate students and trainees.

- Convene seminars, meetups, and visiting talks to grow a cohesive community.

- Establish and disseminate best practices for data access, analytics, and reproducible workflows across campus.
